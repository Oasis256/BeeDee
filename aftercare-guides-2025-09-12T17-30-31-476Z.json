      "content": "THE SIMPLE GUIDE TO BDSM AFTERCARE, COMPLETE WITH 9 THOUGHTFUL AFTERCARE IDEAS Posted by Mistress Tracy on August 16, 2024 Sometimes being an adult is far too serious. Fortunately, as a member of the BDSM community you have kinky playtimes to look forward to. But whether you’re Dominant, submissive, or switch between the two, the anticipation before play and intense sensations while playing can be physically and emotionally draining. Returning to your vanilla duties immediately after a scene can be brutal. Which is why BDSM aftercare is so important. Like all high-octane activities that get the blood pumping and heart racing, you need time to cool down and reset once you’re done. After a workout, you might stretch. After a tough day at the office, you might meditate (or go to the bar). And after any BDSM play you should probably take some aftercare time to come down from your Dom/sub high. But what exactly is ‘aftercare’? And how do you do it? In this guide you’ll find out: What BDSM aftercare is. Why it’s important for both subs and Doms. What it might look and feel like for you and your play partner. How to start including it as part of your BDSM play sessions. BDSM AND FETISH PLAY CAN BE VERY INTENSE Bondage, domination, and sadomasochistic games are a breather from vanilla life. They let you explore physical and mental sensations you wouldn’t otherwise, resulting in a very intense experience. How the body and mind react to BDSM play depends on the individual as well as the nature of the scene. But generally speaking, most scenes include some level of stress. That stress could be physical, such as arms being tied above the head or being suspended in the air by ropes. Or it could be mental, such as roleplaying a consensual non-consent scene. When you experience stress, your body releases cortisol, endorphins, and adrenaline. This concoction of natural chemicals buzzing around the body can affect how your brain receives and accepts pain. Neuroscientist and sadist Hermes SolenzolIt believes it can even make pain feel pleasurable. Encountering such powerful physical sensations and emotions can be confronting. But it can also be beautifully liberating. And it’s this liberation from any other thought than those connected to the ‘right here, right now’ of the scene that can lead to a place called ‘subspace’. WHAT IS SUBSPACE? Subspace is the altered state of mind a submissive partner can experience during play. Here’s how Dr Brad Sagarin, a professor of social psychology leading the team at The Science of BDSM, describes subspace. ‘Bottoms [the people who are bound, receiving stimulation, and/or following orders] show evidence of an altered state associated with a temporary impairment of the brain’s executive function capability accompanied by feelings of floating, peacefulness, time distortion, and living in the here and now.’ Dr Sagarin goes on to say that if and when a Dominant experiences an altered state of mind, they tend to experience perfect flow – ‘a highly pleasurable mental state associated with focused attention, a loss of self-consciousness, and optimal performance.’ (You may hear this referred to as ‘top space.’) Reaching subspace or top space may not happen during every BDSM session. And it’s not a big deal if it doesn’t. It’s a bit like sex and orgasms. You can have a fulfilling and enjoyable experience even if you don’t experience the Big O. WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN But elevated feelings of dreamy amazingness can’t last forever. The adrenaline and endorphins your brain and body produce during play start to decrease once the stimulation stops. And if the sensations you were reveling in stop too suddenly, you may experience ‘sub drop’ or ‘top drop’. Drops can leave you feeling sad, tearful, and emotionally low. It’s very similar to post-coital dysphoria after sex. But BDSM drops can also lead to physical manifestations such as body shakes, headaches, and nausea. Coming down steadily from the height of a scene and engaging in BDSM aftercare can lessen (if not prevent) the symptoms. BDSM AFTERCARE IS A CHANCE TO UNWIND Aftercare is the steps you and your play partner take to bring yourself back to reality. How you do that depends on your relationship, closeness, and boundaries. Here are 9 BDSM aftercare suggestions that may work for you and your partner. Aftercare is the steps you and your play partner take to bring yourselves back to reality. 1 - Tending to Wounds or Injuries Leaving marks on the skin is a boundary that should be discussed before play begins. But if it’s agreed that the spanking, whipping, or bondage you indulge in can leave marks, your aftercare may involve treating them. Offering a damp, cool cloth or applying a moisturizing lotion may feel lovely and soothe the skin. 2 - Cuddling, Kissing, and Affectionate Strokes Things may be said and done during a scene that fit the style of play but don’t necessarily reflect how you feel about each other. Cuddling, kissing, or gently stroking your partner’s chest, arm or head offers reassurance that all is well between you both. 3 - Sleeping As with any physical or mental activity, BDSM play can leave you feeling exhausted. So your aftercare may be as simple as giving yourself permission to sleep. A 20-minute power nap may be all it takes. 4 - Taking a Shower or Bath Whether it’s to ease aches and pains, refresh and revive yourself, or unwind after the intensity of a scene, taking a bath or shower (with or without your partner) is a great BDSM aftercare tonic. 5 - Offering Blankets and Comfortable Clothing Being held in position, probed with toys, and generally exposed during a scene can leave a submissive feeling exposed. Once the scene is over, there may be a great urge to want to cover up. Having loose-fitting clothing nearby and blankets to wrap yourselves in can feel welcoming, safe, and comfortable, as well as help calm the nervous system. 6 - Having Something to Eat and Drink Play may last an hour or more. And while you can pause to have something to eat and drink, it may not always be practical. Have water and snacks ready for afterwards so you can rehydrate and replenish your energy levels. 7 - Chatting A lot can happen during a scene, and BDSM aftercare time is an opportunity to talk about it. It’s a chance for each of you to share: What you liked. What you didn’t like. What worked well. How you felt during different parts of the scene—physically and emotionally. Chatting as part of aftercare may be especially important if the scene included humiliation play such as small penis humiliation. Saying hurtful things, or being on the receiving end of them, can affect different people in different ways. Discussing what was said, and acknowledging that you don’t really think or feel those things, may be important for both Doms and subs. 8 - Listening to Music or Watching TV Ideally the music, film, or TV show you put on will help you relax. You may choose something you’ve heard or watched a thousand times before so you can easily take comfort in the familiarity of it. 9 - Meditating and Breathing Whether you want to slow your heart rate, release any areas of tension, or take a quiet moment to process what’s just happened, being still in meditation and focusing on your relaxed breathing is a chance to do it. ENJOY YOUR AFTERCARE TIME, DON’T RUSH IT Aftercare is something most professional Dominants include in their session time. They have a duty and a responsibility to make sure their submissive is well enough to return to their vanilla life. They also need a chance to decompress after planning and executing the scene. If BDSM aftercare is new to you and your partner, start talking about it a few days before your next play session. Think about how you might like to unwind, and then work out a way to move from the end of the scene into your new aftercare routine. Recovery time will depend on the individual, as well as the kind of play you experienced. You may only need 15 minutes after a bit of light bondage. But if you’re recovering from an intense spanking you may need an hour or more. It may even be worth considering extended aftercare. For some Doms and subs, drops can come hours or days after a scene has finished (a bit like the holiday blues). Checking in with your play partner a day or two later shows great heart and great care. READY TO PLAY? You now know what BDSM aftercare is, and why it’s important for maintaining your physical and mental health. You also have some ideas about what type of aftercare may work for you. All that’s left to do now is start playing.

A 20-minute power nap may be all it takes. 4 - Taking a Shower or Bath Whether it’s to ease aches and pains, refresh and revive yourself, or unwind after the intensity of a scene, taking a bath or shower (with or without your partner) is a great BDSM aftercare tonic. 5 - Offering Blankets and Comfortable Clothing Being held in position, probed with toys, and generally exposed during a scene can leave a submissive feeling exposed. Once the scene is over, there may be a great urge to want to cover up. Having loose-fitting clothing nearby and blankets to wrap yourselves in can feel welcoming, safe, and comfortable, as well as help calm the nervous system. 6 - Having Something to Eat and Drink Play may last an hour or more. And while you can pause to have something to eat and drink, it may not always be practical. Have water and snacks ready for afterwards so you can rehydrate and replenish your energy levels. 7 - Chatting A lot can happen during a scene, and BDSM aftercare time is an opportunity to talk about it. It’s a chance for each of you to share: What you liked. What you didn’t like. What worked well. How you felt during different parts of the scene—physically and emotionally. Chatting as part of aftercare may be especially important if the scene included humiliation play such as small penis humiliation. Saying hurtful things, or being on the receiving end of them, can affect different people in different ways. Discussing what was said, and acknowledging that you don’t really think or feel those things, may be important for both Doms and subs. 8 - Listening to Music or Watching TV Ideally the music, film, or TV show you put on will help you relax. You may choose something you’ve heard or watched a thousand times before so you can easily take comfort in the familiarity of it. 9 - Meditating and Breathing Whether you want to slow your heart rate, release any areas of tension, or take a quiet moment to process what’s just happened, being still in meditation and focusing on your relaxed breathing is a chance to do it."

          "content": "Aftercare is something most professional Dominants include in their session time. They have a duty and a responsibility to make sure their submissive is well enough to return to their vanilla life. They also need a chance to decompress after planning and executing the scene. If BDSM aftercare is new to you and your partner, start talking about it a few days before your next play session. Think about how you might like to unwind, and then work out a way to move from the end of the scene into your new aftercare routine. Recovery time will depend on the individual, as well as the kind of play you experienced. You may only need 15 minutes after a bit of light bondage. But if you’re recovering from an intense spanking you may need an hour or more. It may even be worth considering extended aftercare. For some Doms and subs, drops can come hours or days after a scene has finished (a bit like the holiday blues). Checking in with your play partner a day or two later shows great heart and great care."

      "content": "What is BDSM Aftercare? It is the period of time that occurs after a safe and kinky scene in which there is a period of recovery for the participants and where they will take care of each other’s emotional and physical needs. It’s a time of reflection and sometimes even spiritual awareness through sex. Aftercare is not sexual in nature. Nor should it be treated as such. All scenes, regardless of the type of play of the people involved, should include some form of aftercare. In the most basic form, aftercare can be described as the willingness to provide support and attention to your partner after a play session. To facilitate the return to an everyday state of mind. Some scenes, and role-playing, will require time to reconnect to the basis of reality. And to re-establish roles that existed outside the scene. Sometimes a scene might be very intense Either physically and emotionally and the participants might need assistance in recovering from that and to unwind. Dominants should not be neglected in this aftercare as well. As some dominants might feel the loss of power and complete control that occurred within the scene and also experience a drop. bdsm care BDSM scenes, no matter the type of play, undoubtedly have the potential to change a person’s head space. It is this change to the headspace. This is as a result to chemical and hormone levels, as to why after care is important. Endorphins are produced along with dopamine, which can affect how you react to pain and derive pleasure from that pain. Hormones Linked to Aftercare Once you have ridden through this, the brain will often release levels of prolactin to help modify and control the levels of dopamine within your system. Prolactin has often been linked to mood swings, irritability and to feelings of depression and alienation. These chemicals and hormones are also responsible for the enjoyment of male chastity. It is for these reasons as to why aftercare within BDSM is so important. Engagement of aftercare is not just about making sure that the other is okay. But the intimacy that occurs between participants can strongly increase the bond and levels of communication between them. Best Practices In Standard BDSM Aftercare Prior to engaging in a scene it might be wise to negotiate forms of aftercare as well. Some people might have different requirements for their aftercare. They might enjoy being cuddled. Or they’re more than happy to remain in the presence of someone. But be given some food and drink and to be left alone until they come to you. People need different things It’s important to recognise and compromise on the level of bdsm aftercare that individuals need following a scene. With that in mind, there’s no single form of aftercare that is readily available. We would like to reiterate here at HellsC that aftercare is something that will need to be negotiated. Just as a regular scene would be. DS Breaking Down BDSM Here is what a standard aftercare sex procedure might look like. It is wise to negotiate through the required level of aftercare before the scene starts. Aftercare might vary between types of play, and intensities of play. The needs of both parties will need to be discussed and a mutual agreement formed. After an agreement has been made and assuming all other negotiations are out of the way then the scene is clear to proceed. Following the conclusion of the scene, the top will ensure that they enter into a state of nurturing where they will attend to the sub. A sub needs to ensure that they will also need to take on both a caring and appreciative state of being. Treatment of Physical Injuries and Removal of Accessories If there has been any physical injuries the top will attend to the wounds and disinfect and dress the wounds. A top will also remove any restrictive restraints, debris or any harmful materials from the submissive. Accessories such as nipple clamps, vaginal pumps and other accessories will also need to be removed. If a blindfold, or mask needs to be removed from the submissive. Then they should consider removing this by giving warning. Ensuring that it is done slowly. They might also choose to leave it on for a short amount of time. And adjust the lighting, to make sure that the sub is not assaulted with bright lights. Warm Environment A submissive will be guided safely and carefully to a comfortable and warm spot that is nearby. Blankets may be given. It is important to note that a submissive may feel hot at the time. But their body temperature may have the tendency to quickly decline. A dominant should have access to clean water. Use of straws might be necessary as a sub might be impaired temporarily. And not have full control of motor skills. A straw will prevent the spillage of water. Dominant should never force the submissive to drink. And should instead offer it and give them the water. Allowing the submissive to drink at a time of their choosing. Positive Verbal Reinforcement The dominant will ensure that they are providing positive and verbal reinforcement to the submissive. To help guide them into a state of mind where peace and serenity exists. A dominant may provide touching to skin that was not used or affected during the play session. This touch is not to be considered a sexual touch, nor used as such. It should also not be intended to torture. This type of touch used should be aimed to provide soothing and relaxation. It should be intermittently applied and with respect given to the submissive’s needs. A dominant should also provide the option of giving the submissive chocolate (on the provision that there is no medical condition that forbids this.). Chocolate will not only assist with increasing blood sugar levels but also aid in the release of oxytocin. Dominant should continue providing intermittent and positive reinforcement as well as a nurturing touch. A dominant should, whenever possible, continue to provide nurturing and assistance to the submissive until the submissive is alert and awake and in a position to care for themselves. They also need to be in what is considered to be a good head space. A dominant should not leave the submissive before this time. As doing so may lead the submissive to feeling abandoned. Or in a position where they might injure themselves. For example falling over because their legs have not yet recovered. All toys used, need to be cleaned and put away in a proper and safe way. Any metal sex toy devices that was used needs to be cleaned and correctly stored Any leather equipment that was used also need to be cleaned, cared for and correctly stored. All parties involved should ensure that the others are in a positive mood, and good frame of mind, before leaving. Aftercare with hugging Aftercare For The Dominant In some situations, the dominant will also experience a drop and require after care. Ultimately, the dominant is still responsible and required to care for the bottom during aftercare. Though mutual agreement might come to some form of arrangement regarding this. It is unwise for a dominant to extend themselves during play. In such a way that would compromise their ability to provide care for the submissive. If the top regularly experiences a drop, then it might be advised to organize a third party with which aftercare can be arranged. Babysitters Although it is normally advised that a dominant should be in a position to provide suitable aftercare. There may be rare instances where this is not possible. A submissive might require more time than usual to come down. And a dominant might simply be not in a position to do so. In such a situation a babysitter might be utilized, being a third party kink-friendly individual who can take on the responsibility of aftercare for the submissive. In such situations, it is still highly recommended and considered to be good practice for the dominant to spend at least 15 minutes with the submissive. So that immediate feelings of abandonment and hopelessness do not set in. A babysitter should be a mutually agreed upon person by all involved. Who can continue the responsibilities of aftercare once the dominant is required to leave. dangers of sub drop Dangers Of Sub-Drop In BDSM It’s difficult to talk about the idea of head spaces without referring to the drop. Commonly it is more associated with submissives. Known as sub-drop. But the feeling and sensation can also occur within dominants and be known as dom-drop. It is a mind state that is similar to the sensations of depression and will occur after an intense BDSM scene. Caused by the sudden drop of endorphins and adrenalin that will occur after the spikes within the play. There is speculation as to why it occurs less within dominants. Most rational train of thought is that Dominant types experience a different form of energy than their submissive counterparts. A dominant doesn’t necessarily experience the same endorphin and emotional high as a result of the activities. Symptoms of a sub-drop Difficulty with memory, details and making decisions. Decreased levels of energy. Feelings of guilt and helplessness. Strong feelings of pessimism. Excessive sleeping or insomnia. Increased irritability and restlessness. Loss of interest in activities that were once deemed to be pleasurable. Appetite loss and over eating. Persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety or ‘empty’ feelings. Thoughts of suicide. Subdrop and domdrop can have a variety of different symptoms But the ones listed above are the most common. In some serious cases of subdrop it could involve flu like symptoms and result in sickness. As a result of the stress to the body lowering the immune system. You can see in the above symptoms subdrop is almost always accompanied by feelings of depression, anxiety or lethargy. Symptoms might present themselves almost immediately or they might take up to 72 hours to form. One sub might get sick and feel nauseated while another might get headaches. Another still might decide to sleep for the next day. It affects people differently. Might be prudent if you are dominant to ensure that you let your submissive playmate know after a scene that you are there for them. And that you will be checking in with them over the next few days. This is an excellent form of aftercare that should be practiced. Delayed onset of sub-drop can be surprising. You might find yourself riding the high of the experience and all of a sudden your body will just crash. There is however some steps that you can take to help minimise the effects of sub drop and potentially even prevent it from happening. Tips On Avoiding Sub Drop 1. Food And Drink. Some dominants will often ensure that their sub has had a light meal and water before embarking on a play date. Consumption of food will not only improve sexual performance, but also aid in recovery as well. Admittedly, not all scenes have this time however it is useful to get to know each other, finalise any last minute negotiations and consider it as a form of tension building foreplay. It is important that you are well hydrated before playing a scene, and the food will ensure that there is a sustained releasing of energy throughout the scene. 2. Consume Chocolate. Effects of chocolate are well known and it is often said to incite the same chemical release that occurs during sex. Eating chocolate after a period of play helps mirror the effects of oxytocin and will assist in the building of intimacy during aftercare between play partners. 3. Physical Contact Reaching out to the partner that you have just played with is beneficial in preventing a drop. Having the ability, and the time to come down with them after a scene indicates good BDSM practice. It might be just cuddling on the couch for an hour, or watching a movie and being near each other, it might involve going across the road for a coffee and holding hands. Physical contact increases the level of intimacy and releases chemicals into the body which can minimise the effects of a sub drop. 4. Completing A Task Or A Chore. Through completing a task or a chore, hopefully a productive one that is both simple and easy will not only allow you to distract yourself, but also give you a sense of accomplishment.
