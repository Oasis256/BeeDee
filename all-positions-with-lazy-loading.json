        "description": "If you're the receiving partner, being on top during your first time might be a little intimidating, but it has its pros. Namely, you get full control over how deep you want to go. Have your partner sit on a couch, then kneel over them. One of you can hold onto their penis or strap-on to guide it in as you lower yourself onto them. It’s okay to go as slowly as you want—it just makes it hotter. Once aboard, put your hands on their shoulders, and use your legs to push yourself up and down so that you’re riding their penis or strap-on. Once you get the hang of it, you can gyrate, grind against them, or stop for a moment for a long kiss. If you're craving rumblier sensations, a penis or strap-on ring works wonders here.",

Because it's such an intense and vulnerable experience, it's not likely to happen during casual sex or if you aren't feeling close to your partner.

(The receiver’s legs will be in up a V-shape.) “The penetrating partner kneels between their thighs, holding their ankles for stability and control. Invite gentle movement—hips rocking, micro-adjustments, vocal expression—so both partners stay tuned to sensation rather than performance.”",

Pros: More skin-to-skin contact that creates a cocooned, nurturing feel, says Maguire.Cons: According to Maguire, the deep angle can be overwhelming if the receiver isn’t fully relaxed or aroused. So, use lube. Lots of it. A high quality one you know and love.Switch It Up: The giver can hold both the receiver’s legs together on one side to switch up the stimulation and add a tighter feelMake It Hotter: “Place a pillow under the receiver’s sacrum to tilt the hips upward, easing pressure and enhancing pleasure,” she says.SHOP NOW Luxe Lube Neroli, $36, Lubify",

Pros: “This angle deepens penetration and frees the hands for touch, connection, or stimulation,” she says.Cons: If flexibility is an issue, the receiver might not be able to get their legs over their partner’s shoulders. They can try putting their feet on their partner’s chest or wherever else seems comfortable, and/or use a pillow or sex wedge for optimal angling.Switch It Up: Since the giver’s hands are free in this version, they can use lubed up fingers to rub the receiver’s clit. A lubed-up palm pressed gently on the entire vulva is a good warm up move. Make It Hotter: The giver can kiss and suck on the receiver’s toes.",

        "description": "How to Do It: “The apex involves the receiving partner standing in front of a sturdy stool, bench, or similar furniture, leaning forward with arms outstretched and palms on the seat for support,” says Wright. “The partner who’s penetrating stands behind them, lifting the receiving partner's pelvis to hip height. Then, the partner who is receiving wraps their legs around their partner's waist (behind them) while pressing their feet against their partner's glutes.”",
        "howToDoIt": "Cons: “Without proper support, the receiving partner may feel strain in the wrists, shoulders, or lower back, making it challenging to sustain for a longer sex session,” she says. If/when it switches from a challenge to “help!” the receiver can try lowering themselves onto their elbows. Or just step from the stool and try something else.",

If the giver has strength or mobility issues, they can lean over the bed and rest their weight on their hands.

Try lying on your sides facing each other. “It can be more comfortable and it helps with height differences,” says Brito. And don't be afraid to incorporate a flavored lube, to make the whole experience just a little sweeter.",

Have your partner sit on said chair while you kneel with your ass in their face, straddling them. Bend so your booty is in the air and prop your hands up on the ground for extra support while they go to town on you. The rush of blood to the head will make it all worth it.",
