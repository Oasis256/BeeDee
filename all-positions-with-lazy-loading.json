Start in missionary with one person on top of the other, then arrange yourselves so that your vulvas are pressing directly against each other's, or against your partner’s thigh or pubic bone. “The majority of vulva owners don’t climax from penetration, so they can make the missionary position all about clitoral stimulation by grinding against each other’s thighs and pubic bones, one on top of the other, instead of penetrating,” says Alma Ramírez Acosta, a sexual wellness expert.",

Get in missionary and wear a blindfold, turn the lights off, and overload your auditory systems with loud music. Lay down a silk or satin sheet, or place something soft and furry between your bodies. Pros: “Playing with the senses heightens your response to touch, sound, sight, and more,” says O'Reilly. Plus, it’s a fun and different adventure to have together.Cons: Some people are nervous about being blindfolded. They can just close their eyes with the option to open them anytime they need to. Switch It Up: Try different sessions with different intents. Take it romantic, exploratory, or in a more BDSM direction, depending on where your passions lie.Make It Hotter: If you want to go deeper into sensory play, try temperature play using heating and/or cooling lubes, ice cubes, chilled or warmed dildos, etc…",

But if you try it with a sense of play and just let yourself explore, you might discover some new stuff you’re into.Switch It Up: If both of you have a vulva, use a vibrating strap-on with internal stimulation that can do it for you both. Make It Hotter: Play up the Dom/sub elements by having the person on top really get in character as the conqueror instead of the conquered. They can talk dirty, like telling the person on the bottom what they’re going to do to them, or how they own them or….",

Get in missionary and wear a blindfold, turn the lights off, and overload your auditory systems with loud music. Lay down a silk or satin sheet, or place something soft and furry between your bodies. Pros: “Playing with the senses heightens your response to touch, sound, sight, and more,” says O'Reilly. Plus, it’s a fun and different adventure to have together.Cons: Some people are nervous about being blindfolded. They can just close their eyes with the option to open them anytime they need to. Switch It Up: Try different sessions with different intents. Take it romantic, exploratory, or in a more BDSM direction, depending on where your passions lie.Make It Hotter: If you want to go deeper into sensory play, try temperature play using heating and/or cooling lubes, ice cubes, chilled or warmed dildos, etc…",

But if you try it with a sense of play and just let yourself explore, you might discover some new stuff you’re into.Switch It Up: If both of you have a vulva, use a vibrating strap-on with internal stimulation that can do it for you both.

Namely, you get full control over how deep you want to go. Have your partner sit on a couch, then kneel over them. One of you can hold onto their penis or strap-on to guide it in as you lower yourself onto them. It’s okay to go as slowly as you want—it just makes it hotter. Once aboard, put your hands on their shoulders, and use your legs to push yourself up and down so that you’re riding their penis or strap-on. Once you get the hang of it, you can gyrate, grind against them, or stop for a moment for a long kiss. If you're craving rumblier sensations, a penis or strap-on ring works wonders here.",

Dental dams, aka rectangular pieces of plastic you put over your vulva as a barrier between your mouth and genitals, can actually be super sexy if you know this trick. Have the receiver get on their hands and knees, and drape the dam over their vulva and anus. The giver can then get down and dirty with oral and rimming freely. This is also a great toe-in-the-water move for people who want to experiment with rimming.",

Communicate clearly to ensure your pleasure is being prioritized and chose partners who you know will respect your boundaries. Then strap in (perhaps literally?) and enjoy. “Being sandwiched like that by two men can be extremely pleasurable for the woman,” says Inka Winter, a director of erotic films for women at ForPlayFilms. If you’d like to incorporate the “classic” high-five style, see the photo above for reference. But you can also just…exorcise the bro vibe entirely and have them place their hands on your shoulders and hips. Or, as Winter says, “What would make it a real Eiffel Tower position would be the two penetrating partners kissing each other!” Just an idea!",
