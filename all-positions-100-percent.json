The giver enters by lying on top and holding themselves up a bit.Pros: This one's great for deep penetration, and since the penetrating partner is hovering, it allows space for the receiver to slide in their hands or a sex toy for clitoral stimulation.Cons: If you aren't proactive about clit stim, it won’t happen. The space is there for a reason—don't be afraid to use it!Switch It Up: For even more space for hands or toys, the giver can sit back on their knees and the receiver can drape their legs over their partner’s thighs.Make It Hotter: The giver can build anticipation by teasing the receiver for slightly longer than necessary with kisses all over the body, licks up the inner thighs, and sucking on their earlobes until they beg for more.

For folks who cannot cum via penetration alone, the vibrator adds tons of extra stimulation. And people who can cum from penetration will dig the internal and external stimulation combo. Cons: Wand vibrators are strong AF. If it’s too much, wrap it in a towel or t-shirt.Switch It Up: Change the vibe (literally) by subbing in a clit-sucking toy.

Stimulation in multiple areas of the body at the same time can help many people orgasm much easier.” How To Do It: The receiver lies on their back in missionary position but curves up so their feet or legs are on their partner’s shoulder in a V shape.

        "description": "How to Do It: Play with power dynamics by having one person sit back in a chair. They give their partner directions on exactly how to touch them—where, how hard/fast, what body part or toy and how long. The giver obeys. Pros: The person in the charge gets exactly what they want, as they want it. And for the giver, it’s a crash course in what their partner likes. Cons: If the chair boss isn’t used to being so bossy, it can feel awkward at first. They can try using gestures or guiding their partner’s hand if they feel too weird giving verbal instructions. Switch It Up: Having the chair boss wear a blindfold makes this feel completely different.Make It Hotter: If you have a shower seat and a detachable shower head, try a steamy bathroom version.

Cons: Requires a lot of strength and general bravery.

Cons: Tables aren’t super comfortable. Put down a cushy (and washable) blanket for comfier experience.Switch It Up: Literally switch it up by trading places.

Cons: The up-close eye contact might be too intense for some. If so, just bring it into a hug to keep the intimacy without the eye contact. Switch It Up: For a non-penetrative option, lube up your hands and stroke each other as you rock and grind.

Pros: The person on top can control how slow or fast they want to go.

One person sits obediently down, the other binds their wrists to the chair’s arms. “Use silk scarves, neckties or a bondage kit.” The giver teases the receiver with their hands and mouth and/or a toy.Pros: Bondage helps you both focus on the moment and play with dominance and submission. Cons: Being completely restrained can be upsetting or uncomfortable for some people. For a less hardcore version, the giver can just hold down the receiver’s wrists with their hands, ready to let go immediately if the receiver doesn’t like it.Switch It Up: If one of you is usually more submissive, switch roles and see what happens.Make It Hotter: You can also tie the receiver down at their ankles or use a blindfold to tease and build anticipation, says O’Reilly.

Because it's such an intense and vulnerable experience, it's not likely to happen during casual sex or if you aren't feeling close to your partner. You have to be in a place where you feel very open, safe, and relaxed.”How to do it: The receiver gets on their hands and knees in doggy style. The giver kneels to enter from behind.Make it hotter: The giver can help the receiver relax—and be more receptive to an orgasm—by talking them through it.
